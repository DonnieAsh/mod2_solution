  <p id="box"> Chicken is our most popular entree. We keep this item simple and packed at the same time. We sprinkle the top with sea salt and spanish black peper and fill it with zen stuffing.
  </p></div>
  <div class="lgcol3 mdcol6"><p id="box">Got Beef with us? Of COURSE you do! Our beef is slowly cooked overnight and marinated in our original house seasoning. Twelve ounces of this will leave you upset that you did not order more!
  </p></div>
  <div class="lgcol3 mdcol6"><p id="box">Sushi has arrived! Our classical California Roll has authentic crab, avocado and cucumber toped with shiro goma. Eight cuts of this plate will leave you wanting more.</p></div>
