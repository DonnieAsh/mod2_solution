   Chicken is our most popular entree. We keep this item simple and packed at the same time. We sprinkle the top with sea salt and spanish black peper and fill it with zen stuffing. Yummy!

  Got Beef with us? Of COURSE you do! Our beef is slowly cooked overnight and marinated in our original house seasoning. Twelve ounces of this will leave you upset that you did not order more!
